# Tests `tests/mock/server/mail` Instructions

This folder will hold:

()=> - Tools to run a mock email server when the tool `sendEmal` flags `--test`
()=> - A disposible mock email server for `sendEmail` testing that mimics a remote email server or service, but requires no sensitive information
   ()=>  - NOTE - but use cliche or built in authorization data so the tools authorization methods can be tested
